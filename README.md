# Lean learning materials
_Here's my collection of some useful tutorials about Lean, functional programming and logical verification_.

### 1. General

* [Lean Manual](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/print.html)
  
* [Games](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/) for getting in touch with Lean for a first glance

### 2. Functional programming

* [Learn you Haskell for a great good](https://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters): In case that I want to review some concepts from Haskell

* [Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/introduction.html)

* [The Hitchhiker's guide](https://github.com/blanchette/interactive_theorem_proving_2024/blob/main/hitchhikers_guide_2024_lmu_desktop.pdf)

  * Chapter 5: Functional Programming
  * Chapter 6: Effective Programming(Monad)
  * Chapter 7: Metaprogramming

* Lean Manual:
  * Chapter 11: [Functions](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/functions.html)
  * Chapter 12: [Monads](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/monads/intro.html)

* [Functional data structures](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/fds/SS24/index.html): Lecture from Prof.Nipkow using Isabelle/HOL
  
### 3. Theorem proving

* Book: [Theorem proving in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/title_page.html)

* Book: [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/C08_Groups_and_Rings.html)
  
* Lecture from Prof.Blanchette at LMU: [Interactive theorem proving](https://github.com/blanchette/interactive_theorem_proving_2024)
  
* Lecture from CMU: [15-815 Interactive theorem proving](https://leanprover.github.io/cmu-15815-s15/index.html)

### 4. Logic fundations

* A [list](https://logic.cmu.edu/courses.html) of logic courses offered by CMU
  
* Lectures from Prof.Nipkow at TUM:
    * [Semantics of programming language](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/semantics/WS23/index.html)
    * [Logic](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/logic/SS22/index.html)
    * [Lamba Calculus](https://www21.in.tum.de/teaching/lambda/WS23/index.html)

* Lectures from Cambridge University:
